        "Why do I need to sign-up/register to use a hosted playground?",
      category: "Meshery Playground",
      answer: `
- The Playground is connected to live Kubernetes clusters, and while these clusters are refreshed on a daily basis, the clusters do need to be protected from nefarious actors, who might use these clusters for cryptomining, for example.
- Sign-up to receive a user account, entitled with perpetually free and full access the Playground environment.
- a hosted playground is connected to live Kubernetes cluster(s) and allows users full-control over those clusters. Requiring users to register a user account keeps the Playground safe and healthy for all to enjoy. Without requiring users to sign-in, a hosted playground would allow anonymous access for anyone and everyone to potentially perform nefarious acts.

- No, all of the designs that you have created in the hosted playground are saved to your user account and will be available to you each time that you sign into your account. Your designs will be available in the hosted playground and any your other Meshery deployments, too.
- In other words, all work done in Kanvas Designer is persisted to your user account.

      answer: `
- Yes, the hosted playground clusters are reset on a daily basis. However, only deployments (not designs) that you may have created will be lost.
- In other words, only Kanvas Visualizer is reset. All of your work in Meshery UI and Kanvas Designer will remain in your user account.

      question:
        "When I add my Kubernetes cluster to a hosted playground will it be available to all other users? Can other people access my cluster?",
      category: "Meshery Playground",
      answer: `
No, they can't, unless you explicitly allow them to do so. It's important to understand the following controls and system behavior:
 - **Ownership**: Every connection to a Kubernetes cluster is created by and owned by the individual that provided the Kubernetes context. That individual may elect to share the connection with others on their team (if you have invited anyone to your team(s)).
 - **Permission**: If you do grant other team members access, you do so by creating an environment, assigning that Kubernetes connection to the environment, then creating a workspace and assigning that environment to the workspace. Users of any of your teams to which you have shared access to the workspace will then have permission to access the cluster.
 - **Connectivity**: Those individuals will have to be afforded network connectivity to that cluster (in whatever fashion you deem appropriate). There are two ways in which this can occur:
    - The other user runs their own copy of Meshery (or signs into a shared instance like the Playground) and will see the connection as being available when they sign in. Their Meshery Server will need to be able to reach your Kube API over the network. How that is done can be any number of ways and is left unto your own devices.
    - The other user signs into your Meshery Server instance, which has network access to your Kubernetes cluster. In order for the other user to sign into your Meshery Server, you would have to expose it to the Internet or VPN orâ€¦ one of the many other ways to grant them access to your Meshery Server.
So, in short, you can share access to your Kubernetes cluster with other users, but you have to explicitly grant them access to do so. For more information please visit Remote Provider Permissions - https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility/authorization.
